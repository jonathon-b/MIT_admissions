Hello, thanks for taking a look at my code!

The PID code is located in the PID.h file (c++); it was written in collaboration with two of my robotics teammates

My shooter code (java) is in the shooter_code folder. It was written entirely by me except for the GDV5 & SoundDriverHo files in the Util folder. Those were provided by my computer science teacher

Feel free to download the jar (JonathonP4Shooter.jar) and play my java game (requires java installation on your pc; I reccomend OpenJDK)

If you'd like to get into contact with me, or have any questions about this repo's content, contact jonathonbower14@gmail.com
